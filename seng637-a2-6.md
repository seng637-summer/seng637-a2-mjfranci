# 1 Introduction

This assignment was designed to help us develop an understanding of automated unit testing fundamentals. We familiarize ourselves with the JUnit tool from the XUnit framework, a commonly used unit testing framework in Java. We wrote automated test code using JUnit and created mock objects during test code development.
Before the start of this assignment, our existing knowledge of automated unit testing and black-box testing was limited to the material discussed in lectures so far. We know that JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java that helps for large scale automated testing and is widely used in industry. We also know that Javadoc is a document that contains details of the software to test, and that we should use the Javadoc to gather requirement specifications for generating test suites.
A JUnit test case consists of annotations to control the flow of execution of a unit test and assertions that verify the behavior of the unit being tested. Mocks are fake Java classes that replace external dependencies that should be removed for unit testing and isolating functionalities. Black-box testing is a way JUnit tests plans and cases can be designed when only the requirements are known and the code being tested is unknown. Black-box design techniques include equivalence classes and boundary value testing.
Although these concepts have been learned in class, most of us did not have previous experience with performing automated unit testing with JUnit, using JMock to create and use mock objects, or creating black-box unit tests based on requirements outlined in Javadocs.



# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Different test plans for Range and DataUtilities will be used since these two classes have different functionalities. The first step in designing test plans is to choose an appropriate domain for the input parameters for each class. For the test cases in the Range class, a domain of -100 to 100 will be used because of how comprehensive these range of values are - various positive values, negative values, and a value of zero will be used. For test cases in the DataUtilities classes, jMock will be used to mock the Values2D and KeyedValues classes. The Values2D object will be mocked as a 2-dimensional matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns. Based on these input domain values, separate partitions can be created for equivalence class testing and boundary values can be determined for boundary value testing.
